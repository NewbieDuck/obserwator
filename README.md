Write a set of classes and a skeleton program that solves the problem shown below using the Observer pattern. Remember that this is to be an object-oriented program.

A store offers a certain set of goods that it imports from different countries, so each good has 2 prices: the original one (in foreign currency) and the local one, in PLN. The current exchange rates are published in the National Bank of Poland. After each change in currency rates, all local prices in the store should be recalculated.

Consider several possibilities and choose the best one according to you:
the bank notifies you of any change in the exchange rate (of any currency) - the bank notifies you of changes in the exchange rates of only those currencies used by the store in question
when notifying the change, the bank also sends the rate of the changed currency - the bank informs only about the fact of the rate change
